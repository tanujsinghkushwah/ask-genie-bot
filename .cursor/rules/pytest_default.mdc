# Pytest Rule

- Use `pytest` for all test cases and test-related code suggestions.
- Do not use `unittest` or other test libraries.
- Utilize pytest features such as fixtures and parametrization.
- Organize tests in the `tests/` directory with descriptive, consistent naming.
- Example:
    ```
    import pytest

    def test_addition():
        assert 1 + 1 == 2
    ```
- Before running the test cases, activate the virtual environment first using `source .venv/bin/activate` and export the PYTHONPATH using `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src`.
