Create a perplexity style twitter bot for my Saas app X profile https://x.com/AskMeGenie

The bot will have following features:
Searches for posts/comments based on keywords.
Interacts with these posts/comments using AI at particular times in a day
Generates Posts (Text+Image) related to latest tech trends
Responds to any mentions to the profile

Try to use best tech stack components to be free so that whole bot can run free of cost

1. Keywords: Interview, Software Engineer, Leetcode, System Design, High Level Design, Low Level Design, AI, Blockchain, Crypto
2. AI interaction style would be informative, curious, humble.
3. We can execute the posts/comments when we choose to run the bot. We can later automate it using a github actions cronjob.

Use gemini API with 'gemini-2.0-flash' model for the bot.
