# Code Refinement Policy

- NEVER accept verbose or redundant code without simplification.
- ALWAYS simplify complex logic and avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Use clear, consistent naming and break long functions into smaller parts.
- Validate inputs, avoid hardcoded secrets, and handle errors securely.
- Make sure the generated code is scalable and production ready.
