# General Best Practices

- Use snake_case for variable and function names.
- Document all public APIs with clear docstrings.
- Handle API responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- Reference important files or directories in rules for context-aware suggestions.
- Use exponential backoff for API retries.
- Always include `exc_info=True` in `logger.error()` calls within exception handlers to ensure full stack traces are logged for debugging.
