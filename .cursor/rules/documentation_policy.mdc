# Documentation & Markdown File Creation Policy

## Do NOT Auto-Create Documentation Files

- **NEVER** create markdown files (.md, .markdown) unless explicitly asked by the user
- **NEVER** create documentation without a specific user request like "create a README" or "write documentation for..."
- **DO NOT** assume documentation needs to be created as part of code changes
- **DO NOT** create architecture diagrams, guides, or reference documents unless requested

## When Documentation IS Requested

- Only then create .md files with comprehensive, well-structured content
- Include clear headings, examples, and context
- Follow markdown best practices (proper formatting, links, code blocks)
- Keep documentation focused and relevant to the request

## Minimal Documentation Exceptions

- Brief inline comments in code are acceptable
- Docstrings in Python functions are required (follow PEP 257)
- Type hints and parameter descriptions are encouraged
- DO NOT create separate .md files for these

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on code implementation, not documentation
- Let user drive documentation needs
- Code should be self-documenting where possible
- Comments should explain the "why", not the "what"
