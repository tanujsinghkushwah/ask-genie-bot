# Minimal Code Change Rule

- When editing code or tests, make only the minimal required changes to achieve the intended functionality.
- Do not reformat or rewrite unrelated code sections.
- Preserve existing code style, structure, and comments unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Prefer inline suggestions and focused edits over full-file rewrites.
- Always activate .venv before running any command
